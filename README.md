Minesweeper Engine
==================
This is a minesweeper implementation in python. It is not an interactive game,
but an engine for evaluating game AI algorithms. Versions made for interactive
playing tend to not place any mines until the player has selected the first
square and may layout the mines to guarantee success if the player is perfect.
This implementation does neither.
